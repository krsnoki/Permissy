#Introduction

This project aims to create a web application which eases the process of offline permission and feedback handling for various applications and permissions required within campus.
The lengthy and heavy process of maintaining papers will be digitalized with the online website. Moreover, we aim to save time of both faculty and students by making it simpler with one click.
Without losing personal touch, within the process, we aim to make it happen easier, faster and paperless.
We look forward to build an android version.
